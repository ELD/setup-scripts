# Workstation Setup

A collection of my files/aliases/configs for macOS combined with scripts to
install all of the software I want on my Mac computers.

Heavily inspired by [Pivotal Workstation Setup](https://github.com/pivotal/workstation-setup)

Download it [with this link](https://github.com/ELD/setup-scripts/archive/main.zip) and start it using `./setup.sh`
